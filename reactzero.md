## 🕹️ How to Play

### Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **WASD / Arrow Keys** | Steer your vehicle |
| **Space** | Activate boost (consumes energy) |
| **Shift** | Drift through corners |
| **Mouse** | Navigate menus |

### Gameplay Basics

1. **Complete 3 Laps** - Race against 7 AI opponents and finish first
2. **Manage Energy** - Your energy bar depletes when boosting. Running out ends your race!
3. **Use Boost Pads** - Green pads on the track give free speed boosts
4. **Master Drifting** - Hold Shift to drift through tight corners without losing speed
5. **Choose Your Machine** - Each vehicle has different stats:
   - **Blue Thunder** - Balanced performance
   - **Red Comet** - Maximum top speed, slower acceleration
   - **Green Wind** - Quick acceleration, sharp turning
   - **Golden Fox** - Drift specialist

## 🏁 Tracks
